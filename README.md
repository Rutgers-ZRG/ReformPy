            contract: bool
                Calculate fingerprint vector in contracted Guassian-type orbitals or not
            
            ntype: int

            lmax: int
                Integer to control whether using s orbitals only or both s and p orbitals for 
                calculating the Guassian overlap matrix (0 for s orbitals only, other integers
                will indicate that using both s and p orbitals)

  abstract = {Structural optimization has been a crucial component in computational materials research, and structure predictions have relied heavily on this technique, in particular. In this study, we introduce a novel method that enhances the efficiency of local optimization by integrating extra fingerprint space into the optimization process. Our approach utilizes a mixed energy concept in the hyper potential energy surface (PES), combining real energy and a newly introduced fingerprint energy derived from the symmetry of the local atomic environment. This method strategically guides the optimization process toward high-symmetry, low-energy structures by leveraging the intrinsic symmetry of the atomic configurations. The effectiveness of our approach was demonstrated through structural optimizations of silicon, silicon carbide, and Lennard-Jones cluster systems. Our results show that the fingerprint space biasing technique significantly enhances the performance and probability of discovering energetically favorable, high-symmetry structures as compared to conventional optimizations. The proposed method is anticipated to streamline the search for new materials and facilitate the discovery of novel energetically favorable configurations.}
